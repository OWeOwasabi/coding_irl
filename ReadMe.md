# hello, r/furry_irl!
(or normies, depends on who you are)

## why tho
my programming class at school learned a bit about java graphics, 
and we were challenged to make our own creations! it had to have 
between 8-15 shapes, but we could use as many lines as we wanted.
we also had to title it.

## how do i modify it?
i'm honestly not too sure lol

but i used netbeans in the creation of this project, more 
specifically netbeans 8.2

just a heads up, i'm probably not going to do anything with this
repository since it's creation
